      <h1>The Eternal Food Debate</h1>
    </header>
    <h2>Possibly the most important decision you'll ever make</h2>
    <p>You're hungry. You're tired. You're stuck in eternity and only able to eat one food for the rest of time. The choices should be endless, but there are really only two reasonable ones. This is basically the sequel to Sophie's Choice.</p>
<h3>The stakes are higher than they've ever been. Choose your fate...</h3>
